HoDoKu version 2.2 contains a lot of UI tweaks, including a
complete new display type ([ColorKu mode](http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/docs_intro.php#display_mode_7)) and some bug fixes.
For visually challenged people the font size of the whole GUI (including
all dialogs) can be changed (not applicable under some Linux variants).
Interoperability with other sudoku programs has been increased by
adding various text file formats for puzzles.
